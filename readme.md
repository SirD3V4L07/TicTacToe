Notes for next session:
"move" is not defined at makeMove() because I added a for loop for invalid input check and the scope stays within the for loop. Need to find a way to input check and send out the move value.


To-do List:
-Store the gameboard as an array inside of a Gameboard object
-Players are also going to be stored in objects
-As little global code as possible. Try tucking as much as you can inside factories.
-Each little piece of functionality should be able to fit in the game, player or gameboard objects.
-Focus on getting a working game in the console first.
-Make sure you include logic that checks for when the game is over! 
-Try to avoid thinking about the DOM and your HTML/CSS until your game is working.
-Once you have a working console game, create an object that will handle the display/DOM logic.
-Write the functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board by interacting with the appropriate DOM elements (e.g. letting players click on a board square to place their marker). Donâ€™t forget the logic that keeps players from playing in spots that are already taken!
-Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names, include a button to start/restart the game and add a display element that shows the results upon game end!


Logic Structure:
-Draw empty board
-Player selects a sign
-Coin toss to see who goes first
-playerTurn is true or false depending on coin toss
-Call makeMove(playerTurn)
-makeMove will start with a turn check to evaluate who's turn to play
-if player, a coordinate will be requested for the play, if COM, COM will generate a random play
-The end of makeMove always reverses the boolean value of playerTurn
-Repeat makeMove until winner != ""
-In each iteration of makeMove, coordinates are checked for empty before playing
-In each iteration of Play, victory condition and check for winner

Functions:
Game()
Play()
makeMove()
checkWinner()
